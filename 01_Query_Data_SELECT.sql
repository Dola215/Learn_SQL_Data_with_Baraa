/*
==========================
SELECT Statement
==========================
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
*/

-- SELECT ALL COLUMNS
SELECT * FROM customers;

SELECT * FROM orders;

/*
Selecting Specific Columns
-- Retrieve each customer's name, country and score.
Note:
-- There is no comma after the last column
*/

-- Retrieve each customer's name, country, and score.
SELECT first_name, country, score FROM customers;

/*
==========================
WHERE Clause
==========================
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note: Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.

/* 
==========================
ORDER BY
==========================
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
ASC ==> lowest to Highst
DESC ==> Highst to lowest

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
*/

SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY `score` DESC;

SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY `country` ASC;

-- Retrieve all customers and sort the results by the country and then by the highest score.
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY `country` ASC, `score` DESC;

--Retrieve the name, country, and score of customers whose score is not equal to 0 and sort the results by the highest score first.

/* 
==========================
GROUP BY
==========================
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
aggregates a column by another column.
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

==========================
HAVING
==========================
Using HAVING to filter data after aggregation, can use only with GROUP BY
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

==========================
Removes Duplicates in data (Repeated values)
Each value appera only once in the reusalt
